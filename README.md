This is a rough duct taped together BigShotJb plugin for Snapper 3.

It also contains a CCSupport module plugin, so you don't ACTUALLY need Snapper 3, just CCSupport.

It doesn't take longer screenshots than 10,000 points. Results vary across apps, don't expect perfect performance. Debs available in /packages folder.
